# SLP Private Practice Analysis

## Overview
SLP Private Practice Analysis is a comprehensive data analytics application designed to pull valuable insights from SLP (Speech-Language Pathology) private practices. Utilizing the power of web scraping with BeautifulSoup, this application gathers data directly from designated SLP websites. Following the collection phase, the data undergoes multiple transformations using Pandas to ensure it's structured and ready for in-depth analysis. The refined data is then loaded into Power BI (PBI), where further transpositions and development work takes place, resulting in a dynamic and informative dashboard that offers critical insights into SLP private practices.
